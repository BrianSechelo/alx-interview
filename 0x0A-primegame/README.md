Prime Game
sieve_of_eratosthenes: This function generates all prime numbers up to n using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
play_game: Simulates the game for a single round. The variable turn alternates between Maria and Ben. If the turn is 1 after all primes are removed, it means Ben made the last move, so Maria wins.
isWinner: This function handles multiple rounds of the game. It tracks wins for both Maria and Ben and returns the player with the most wins.
